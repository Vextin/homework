# Homework
### 3110 HW4 - BFS DFS
For algorithms class. Demonstrate Breadth-First and Depth-First searching algorithms.

### 3110 HW2 - Infix Postfix
For algorithms class. Demonstrate methods for converting an arithmetic expression written in infix notation to postfix notation and evaluate postfix notation expressions using a stack. Also includes a parentheses balance checker, I guess.

### 3600 Minor 3 - Producer Consumer Paradigm
I don't remember writing this, but it demonstrates the use of a shared buffer with pthreads and mutex locking.
